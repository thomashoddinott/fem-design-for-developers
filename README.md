## Introduction

### Right vs. Left Brain

Evidence suggests that *left brain vs right brain* turns out to be a myth.

People say stuff like: "I'm a developer, that means I can't do design". 

What the data show is your brain becomes stronger in areas you train it. **So you can learn if you're prepared to go outside of your comfort zone.**

### What this Course Is & Setup

// ??? - "It looks very bootstrapy"

Project setup suggestion:

```
my-project/
├── dev
├── insp
└── src
```

### Perfection

Expectations don't translate to reality right away.

It's an iterative process.

As with coding, we getting better the more we do it.

### Designer vs Developer

"I'm not a designer. I'm a developer who can do design" - :heavy_check_mark:

"but I do have an degree in Art" ... OK :neutral_face:

### Introduction to Layout Grids

Why Grids? - It's a simple way to place *Order on Chaos*

 ### Balance & Symmetry

Symmetry looks good. We've been using it for thousands of years.

^ Nice thing about symmetry is when we break it, our eye is drawn there immediately.

**Symmetry also gets boring.** - dull, basic

### Asymmetry

The world isn't perfectly symmetrical.

It's more difficult. Requires more though. Still using balance, but more carefully.

Example from Western Art:

And Eastern Art:

And Architecture:

### Exploring Asymmetry: Learning from Art History

^ Keeps eyes from leaving Canvas. Your eyes keep circling.

### Shape

Circles draw you eye more than other shapes.

**Saccade** - Eyes keep scanning - Hunter-Gather origins, etc.
