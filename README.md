## Introduction

### Right vs. Left Brain

Evidence suggests that *left brain vs right brain* turns out to be a myth. 

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/right-brainleft-brain-right-2017082512222

People say stuff like: "I'm a developer, that means I can't do design". 

What the data show is your brain becomes stronger in areas you train it. **So you can learn if you're prepared to go outside of your comfort zone.**

### What this Course Is & Setup

// ??? - "It looks very bootstrapy"

Project setup suggestion:

```
my-project/
├── dev
├── insp
└── src
```

### Perfection

Expectations don't translate to reality right away.

It's an iterative process.

As with coding, we getting better the more we do it.

### Designer vs Developer

"I'm not a designer. I'm a developer who can do design" - :heavy_check_mark:

"but I do have an degree in Art" ... OK :neutral_face:

### Introduction to Layout Grids

Why Grids? - It's a simple way to place *Order on Chaos*

 ### Balance & Symmetry

Symmetry looks good. We've been using it for thousands of years.

^ Nice thing about symmetry is when we break it, our eye is drawn there immediately.

**Symmetry also gets boring.** - dull, basic

### Asymmetry

The world isn't perfectly symmetrical.

It's more difficult. Requires more though. Still using balance, but more carefully.

Example from Western Art:

And Eastern Art:

And Architecture:

### Exploring Asymmetry: Learning from Art History

^ Keeps eyes from leaving Canvas. Your eyes keep circling.

### Shape

Circles draw you eye more than other shapes.

**Saccade** - Eyes keep scanning - Hunter-Gather origins, etc.

**Circles** draw your attention.

They live outside of normal lines though - your eyes compensate:

i.e. `padding: -5px` to make it look natural

**Diagonals are dynamic!** - We mostly use table-based layouts but we also find them in Art!

e.g. used on the web:

### Layout Tools

- Photoshop (Adobe) - old and trusted
- Illustrator (Adobe) - old and trusted
- Sketch - https://www.sketch.com/ - more modern, used a lot now.

Doing it outside of the Browser is recommended! 

### Photoshop Keyboad Shortcuts (skipped)
